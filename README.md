# polyArt

Drawing art using a set of polygons. This is a hill climbing problem, minimizing the error. Error from target image is computed using the RMSE.

### To run 

Load polyArt.py and call go on a target image.

### Todo:

Add support to run with variable parameters from go, numVertices, numPolygons etc
Support upper bound on number of polygons
Add support for fine grained tweaking of mutation rate
